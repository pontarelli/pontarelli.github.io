abstract = {Bloom filters and cuckoo filters are used in many applications toreduce the amount of memory needed to check if an element be-longs to a set. The main drawback of these filters is that with lowprobability, a positive is returned for an element that is not in theset. Recently, the concept of Bloom filters with a false positivefree zone has been introduced showing that false positives can beavoided when the universe from which elements are taken and thenumber of elements inserted in the filter are both small. Unfortu-nately, this limits the use of such false positive free Bloom filtersin many practical applications. In this paper, a false positive free,i.e. perfect, cuckoo filter is presented and evaluated. The proposeddesign supports universe sizes of billions of elements and storesmillions of elements, making it practical for a wide range of ap-plications. The perfect cuckoo filter can be also used to perform<key,value> mapping, further extending the range of scenarios inwhich can be used. The benefits of the proposed perfect cuckoofilter are illustrated with two case studies: IP address blacklistingand longest prefix match for IP forwarding.},
